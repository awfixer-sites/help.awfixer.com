### Discord Specific Policies to be aware of:

The Discord Privacy Policy:

This goes over the data that discord themselves collect and how they manage it and what they do with it. Last we checked they do not sell it, though if you subscribe to nitro you are also subject to the Stripe Privacy Policy (which is detailed further down) and if you connect external accounts to your discord account your are giving data away via [clickthrus](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823-Connections-Linked-Roles-Community-Members) that are likely monotized. We use this for parts of our community just to be cute, they are opt in though and we do not force it upon you
