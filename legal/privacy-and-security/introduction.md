# Introduction

## The Goal of AWFixer Legal

the first and primary goal of AWFixer Legal is to ensure that we do not get sued. While we are confident our policy of forgetting your data and our security measures will go far enough to prevent any lawsuit from being successful, we want to also be transparent about the way that we run our businesses.

{% hint style="warning" %}
be aware that we are really aggressive about controlling our software and products as we feel that if we let it go we will be turned into something we find disagreeable, this does not mean that you will see any restrictions on using our products for things that are not illegal (our vpn/proxy policies non-withstanding)
