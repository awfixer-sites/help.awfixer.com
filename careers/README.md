<h4 align="center">There Are no Apply buttons?</h4>

There are not any apply buttons because even though the help is needed, we do not accept applications the way that a traditional business does. We want to see you in our community, making contributions, producing engagement, and interacting with us. When you do that, and as we get to know you - that is how you apply for jobs with us.

We do not feel like a Human Resources Department (HR) is something that we want, or that will drive our company in the right direction. At the core of our being is the idea that we love people. Working with us, you will learn that people are a critical part of our driving mission. Our founders, AWFixer and jinx, had this vision, a vision of a future where companies solve problems, rather than create them - joining us means you will be a part of driving this mission forward.
