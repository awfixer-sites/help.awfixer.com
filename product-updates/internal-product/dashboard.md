# Dashboard

{% hint style="success" %}
we take graat pride in the way things that we build look and work, as you can see from some of our current websites after the rebrand. Because of this desire to pay attention to detail we have been working very hard on creating a dashboard that lives up to those standards, we appreciate your paitents.&#x20;

## The AW\&Friends Dashboard

this is a product that we have been putting a lot of time, effort and thought into. We want it to tie deeply into other product spaces like the help center, the shop and the community discord server. This is going to take a fair amount of work - which we are currently putting in.

We want to ensure that we provide a quality product to you, one that we are as proud of showing you as you are of using. We are currently considering using [Expo](https://expo.dev/) as the host of our dashboard application to ensure immediate cross platform functionality.
