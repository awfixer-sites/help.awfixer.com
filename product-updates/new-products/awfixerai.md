As I mentioned in the [Blog Post](https://awfixer.com/blog/awfixerai-tooling), what we are talking about here will make more sense if you watch this video from Alberta Tech first.

### Why we held off on using AI

so, while we did hold off on AI for the most part, there are a few ways that AI has already been implimented in what we work on. This includes our use of [Graphite](https://graphite.com/?ref=help.awfixer.com/product-updates/new-products/awfixerai), among other review tools with powerful AI features. We also have docs agents enabled, as well as the gitbook agent enabled on this help center. We find that AI being used in moderation, in these ways is useful. The ways that we held off is when it came to producing our own AI based/native/driven products.
