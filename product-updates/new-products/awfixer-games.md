<summary>What sets AWFixer Games apart from other publishers?</summary>

we will be a very hands off publisher. While you are retaining us with the intial fee and the 3% of sales, we do not take any other vested interest in your games. This allows us to protect you, remember you, and have no desire to change your games. Allowing you the creative freedom without the business risk.
