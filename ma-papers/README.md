# Modded Android

Yes, welcome to the Modded Android Papers. Unprofessional, quirky, and not corporate. I will go over my goals here as well as various other things like gereral information, plans, money and other things you may want to know about.

if you are not aware in Modded Android I have taken the [Android 14](https://www.android.com/android-14/) codebase, removed a grand majority of the bloated code, all of the Google stuff, and slimmed down the platform support code, and now I am working on rewriting and porting all of it to modern, secure, fast languages to create the best mobile operating system ever.
